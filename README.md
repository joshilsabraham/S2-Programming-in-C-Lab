# 24SJGXEST204 Programming in C Lab Programs📘

Welcome to the **S2‑Programming‑in‑C‑Lab Programs Repository**!  
This repository contains well‑commented C programs developed as part of the **Programming in C (24SJGXEST204)** lab course during the second semester of **Computer Science Engineering at SJCET, Palai**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each C source file corresponds to a lab exercise or program. Filenames are descriptive to make browsing straightforward:

```plaintext
📁 S2‑Programming‑in‑C‑Lab

```

## 🧩 Key Features

* ✅ **Beginner-Friendly**: Well-commented and concise, suitable for students learning C.
* 🔧 **Modular Design**: Programs grouped by topic—conditional logic, loops, functions, pointers, files.
* 🧠 **Curriculum-Aligned**: Exercises follow KTU EST102 structure including recursion, arrays, and I/O.

## 🎯 Course Objectives 

Aligned with KTU requirements, this course covers:

* Algorithmic thinking and documentation: flowcharts & pseudocode
* Branching, loops, arrays, and string operations
* Modular programming using functions, recursion, structures/unions
* Pointer usage, file I/O, and command-line arguments ([github.com][2], [github.com][3], [github.com][4], [github.com][1])

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `areaofcircle.c`     | Calculates the area of a circle based on user input.                                 |
| `evenorodd.c`        | Checks whether a number is even or odd.                                              |
| `factorial.c`        | Computes factorial using iterative or recursive methods.                             |
| `palindrome.c`       | Checks if a given string or number is palindrome.                                    |
| `recursion.c`        | Demonstrates recursion with mathematical or string-based examples.                   |
| `struct_union.c`     | Uses structures and unions for organized data representation.                        |
| `swap_pointer.c`     | Swaps two variables using pointers (pass-by-reference simulation).                   |
| `simplecalculator.c` | Implements a basic four-function arithmetic calculator.                              |
| `transpose.c`        | Reads a matrix and prints its transpose.                                             |
| *… plus many more:*  | `ifelse.c`, `loop.c`, `matrixaddition.c`, `string_comparison.c`, `functions.c`, etc. |
